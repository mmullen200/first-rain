# First Rain: opening vertical-slice prototype

Throwaway Godot vertical slice for deciding whether the opening teaches movement, finite supplies, scientific observation, ecological intervention, recovery, cultivation, and the first sighting of the Presence through embodied play.

## Run

Open `project.godot` in Godot 4.6 and press **F6/F5**, or run:

```sh
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path prototypes/godot-first-interaction
```

## Controls

- **WASD / arrow keys** — move
- **E** — open the emergency cache, then pick up or place the loose shade panel
- **F** — scan a nearby moss patch
- **Space** — spend one water dose on a nearby moss patch
- **Q** — spend one water dose on the astronaut when exposure is meaningful
- **R** — restart the experiment

## Question under test

Can one tiny 2.5D space carry the player from the crashed ship and finite wreck supplies through comparison with the damaged Field Scanner, a scarce ecological intervention, immediate and delayed feedback, a legible failure and recovery, a persistent scanner discovery record, and the first successful cultivation—without issuing a quest or revealing a recipe?

Moss behavior, water quantities, environmental variables, timing, and the loose shade panel are disposable test fixtures. They do not settle the later rule-set, survival-balance, feedback-tool, or toolkit decisions.

## Cellular ecology added for this revision

The visible square cells now carry provisional moisture, temperature, toxicity, nutrients, dormant moss, living moss, dead biomass, fungus, and shade values. A fixed deterministic tick updates all cells through double-buffered local rules:

- Water wakes dormant moss where temperature and toxicity permit.
- Living moss spreads into adjacent suitable cells and slows evaporation.
- Moss stress and ordinary turnover create dead biomass.
- Fungus awakens where dead biomass remains wet, spreads locally, decomposes it into nutrients, and slightly reduces toxicity.

Cell color is the readable prototype overlay: blue-green indicates moisture, green living moss, brown dead biomass, and violet fungus. The Field Scanner exposes the precise local values while the top-left summary shows the system-wide cell counts.
